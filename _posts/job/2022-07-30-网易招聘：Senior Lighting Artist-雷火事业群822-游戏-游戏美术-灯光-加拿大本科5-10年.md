•	Light scenes and levels beautifully and maintain them throughout all development stages of the game.

•	Get together with Leads and the Art Director to achieve the desired lighting and mood.

•	Share your knowledge often and freely with other members of the team and create easy to understand documentation with visual references and guidelines showcasing efficient work methods.

Things we need from you

•	Be a true team player with the drive to help others succeed with a positive attitude.

•	Exceptional technical understanding of Real Time Lighting.

•	Strong knowledge of Physically Based Rendering and Linear Workflows.

•	Solid knowledge of atmospheric effects, colour grading and other post-process effects.

•	Good understanding of particle-driven effects and shaders.

•	Experience in one or more scripting or programming languages.

•	Knowledge of industry game engines and ideally already exposure to Lighting Solutions in Unreal 5.
